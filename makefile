# This file knows nothing about any particular game. It discovers games by

# file and in the game's Targets/ headers.

#   make GAME=tt REGION=EU PLATFORM=ps2
#   make GAME=tt PLATFORM=ps2 print-config

#
# Normally you would use build.bat, which drives this and then runs the plugin
# injector:
#
#   build gt4o US for:pcsx2
#   build tt EU for:ps2
